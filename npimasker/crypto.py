"""Key generation/derivation and per-value encryption for NPIMasker.

Keys are arbitrary user-supplied strings (a passphrase, or a random string
from `generate_passphrase`). They are run through PBKDF2 with a fixed,
application-level salt to produce a Fernet-compatible key. The fixed salt
is a deliberate simplicity trade-off for a local, single-user tool: it
means the same key string always derives the same encryption key without
needing to store/transmit a per-file salt. Per-value randomness still
comes from Fernet's own IV, so identical cells don't produce identical
ciphertext.
