# NPIMasker

A small local tool that finds and encrypts sensitive data (name, email, phone,
address, SSN, date of birth, NPI/medical record/insurance ID, etc.) in a CSV
file, and decrypts it back with the same key. Everything runs locally — no
data is sent anywhere.

For free-text columns (e.g. "Notes"), it only encrypts the sensitive part of
the text, not the whole cell — e.g. in `"...his name is Kang Li"`, only
`"Kang Li"` gets encrypted. See "How detection works" below for exactly which
columns get this treatment vs. whole-cell encryption.

## Using the Windows app

1. Get `NPIMasker.exe` (see "Building the .exe" below) and double-click it.
2. Choose **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**.
3. Click **Browse...** and pick your CSV file. The column list will show every
   column, with sensitive-looking ones (name, email, phone, address, etc.)
   already checked — untick/tick as needed. Tick any free-text column (like
   "Notes") too if it might contain embedded names, emails, SSNs, or dates —
   NPIMasker will only encrypt the sensitive part of that text, not the whole
   cell.
4. Set the key:
   - First time: click **Generate & Save Key...** to create a strong random
     key and save it to a `.key` file. **Keep this file safe** — anyone who
     has it (and the encrypted CSV) can decrypt your data, and without it the
     data cannot be recovered by anyone, including you.
   - To decrypt later, or to encrypt more files with the same key: click
     **Load Key from File...** and pick that same `.key` file.
5. Confirm the output path (auto-filled next to the input file) and click
   **Run**.
6. Store or send the encrypted CSV and the `.key` file **separately** (e.g.
   don't email them in the same message).

If you decrypt with the wrong key, or a value got corrupted, NPIMasker shows
a clear error instead of silently producing garbage.

## Building the app

- **Windows (.exe):**
  - **GitHub Actions (recommended):** push this repo to GitHub. The workflow
    in `.github/workflows/build-exe.yml` builds `NPIMasker.exe` on a Windows
    runner automatically and attaches it as a downloadable artifact on the
    Actions run.
  - **Build it yourself on a Windows PC:** install Python 3.11+, then run
    `build_windows.bat` in this folder. The exe will be in `dist\NPIMasker.exe`.
- **macOS (.app), for testing locally while developing:**
  - Run `./build_macos.sh` in this folder (installs PyInstaller if needed).
    The app will be at `dist/NPIMasker.app` — double-click it, or `open
    dist/NPIMasker.app` from the terminal.
  - The same GitHub Actions workflow also builds `NPIMasker-macos` on a
    `macos-latest` runner and uploads it as an artifact on every push, so you
    don't have to build locally if you don't want to.

Both builds bundle spaCy and its `en_core_web_sm` model for embedded-name
detection, which noticeably increases build time and app size (packaged app
is roughly 150-250MB) compared to a build without NLP.

## Running from source (any OS, for development)

Requires **Python 3.10+** (spaCy's dependencies require it).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

**macOS note:** Apple's built-in `python3` (`/usr/bin/python3`) links against
the system Tcl/Tk 8.5, which is deprecated and known to render a **blank
window** on recent macOS versions. If you see a blank window or a
`DEPRECATION WARNING` about system Tk, install a Python build with a modern
Tk instead:

```
brew install python@3.12 python-tk@3.12
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python main.py
```

`build_macos.sh` already does this automatically (it creates its own `.venv`
using Homebrew's `python3.12`), so packaged `.app` builds aren't affected —
this only matters when running `main.py` directly with `python3`.

## Running the tests

```
pip install -r requirements.txt pytest
pytest tests/
```

## How detection works

For each column you select, NPIMasker decides how to handle it based on the
column header:

- **Whole-cell columns** — headers matching Name, Phone, Address/Street/
  City/State/Zip, or NPI/Medical record/MRN/Insurance/Policy number are
  encrypted as a whole cell, like before. These categories either have no
  reliable text pattern to search for (phone/address formats vary too much,
  medical/insurance IDs have no fixed format) or benefit from a guarantee
  that the whole value is always protected regardless of what it contains.
- **Scanned columns** — every other selected column (Email/SSN/DOB columns,
  and any free-text column like Notes/Comments) is scanned for PII *within*
  the text, and only the detected substrings are encrypted:
  - Emails, SSNs, and dates (covers DOB) are found with regular expressions.
  - Person names are found anywhere in the text using
    [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)'s named-entity recognition
    (`en_core_web_sm`) — this is what catches a name embedded in a sentence
    like `"...his name is Kang Li"`.
  - Organization names are encrypted too, deliberately: the NER model often
    mislabels unusual person names as organizations (e.g. "Lilly Petlock"),
    and leaking a name is worse than over-encrypting the name of a hospital
    or insurer (which is often itself identifying). Detected name spans are
    also extended over an immediately following attached word the model left
    out (catches "petlock" when only "Lilly" was tagged).
  - This is best-effort, not a guarantee: an all-lowercase name (e.g.
    "lilly petlock") can still be missed entirely, and there's no attempt to
    detect embedded street addresses or phone numbers in free text (put
    those in dedicated, whole-cell columns instead if you need them
    protected reliably).

## How the encryption works

- Each detected piece of sensitive text (a whole cell, or a substring found
  by the scanner above) is encrypted independently with
  [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) (AES-128 + HMAC), so
  identical values produce different ciphertext each time.
- In scanned columns, an encrypted substring is replaced in place with a
  `[[ENC:<token>]]` marker; decrypting finds these markers and swaps back in
  the original plaintext, leaving the rest of the cell's text untouched.
- The key you provide (or generate) is run through PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a
  fixed, application-level salt to derive the actual encryption key. This is
  a deliberate simplicity trade-off for a local, single-user tool: it means
  a given key string always derives the same encryption key without needing
  to manage a separate salt file. If you need protection against attackers
  who might precompute keys for this fixed salt, don't reuse a weak/guessable
  key — use **Generate & Save Key** rather than typing your own passphrase.
- Only the columns you select are touched; everything else in the CSV is
  copied through unchanged.
