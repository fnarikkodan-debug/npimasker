"""Tests for batched NER (find_pii_spans_batch) and the buffered row loop.

process_csv buffers rows so every scanned cell in a chunk goes through
nlp.pipe together instead of one nlp() call per cell. That reorders when
the model runs relative to when rows are written, so the things to pin
down are: identical spans, identical output, and error/progress behaviour
that still refers to the right row.
